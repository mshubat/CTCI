Merge Sort Description:

Merge sort divides the array in half and sorts each of
those halves, then merges them back together. Each half
has the same sorting algorithm applied to it until each
half contains only one number. The merge does the "heavy
lifting".

Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
Space Complexity: O(n) [Depends]
